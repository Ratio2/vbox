    <title>Windows on Arm Hosts</title>
    <body>
        <p>The installation package for Windows 11 includes the ability to run Oracle VirtualBox on an Arm host processor.</p>
        <p>This feature is experimental. If you plan to use it, contact Oracle Sales with an indication of the number of hosts so that we can estimate demand for support of this feature.</p>
