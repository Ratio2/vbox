16th December 2024

*****************

Intention and quality statements for all ArmARM architecture releases
The intention and scope of the Architecture releases is to describe changes from the existing architecture to the next release. The quality of the architecture releases refers to the accuracy and completeness of the changes described in the specifications.

The intention and scope of the XML releases is to describe the content and behavior of the registers, system registers, instructions, pseudocode, and features of the architecture in full for human readers. The release enables correct information for the current or any previous release to be deduced. The quality of the XML releases refers to the accuracy and completeness of the content to a human reader.

The intention and scope of the JSON releases is to describe aspects of the XML releases in a structured, machine readable format. The content of the architectural content will be approximately equivalent to the corresponding XML release. However there are some aspects of the architecture which cannot yet be represented in a machine readable format.

The intention and scope of the Schema for the JSON releases is to describe the syntax and format of the JSON files used in the JSON releases. The schema is still under development and is subject to change.

Product status
The content and quality of this JSON release is approximately equivalent to the 2024-12 XML release.

There are some aspects of the architecture which cannot yet be represented in a machine readable format, and will be omitted.

The package contains the Proprietary Notice which defines the terms and conditions for this release. The README file describes the contents of the package.
